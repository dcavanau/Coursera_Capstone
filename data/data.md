# Data Used FOr the Model

The Data-Collisions.csv file was provided as part of the capstone project course materials. There were issues with the quality of the data provided.

The Collisions.csv file was gotten directly from <a name=Seattle Geo Data>http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com</a>. This data was more complete and a better source for the project.
